(DOJn press release)""",31,Male,Black/African/African American,"""Lashawn L. Wilks, 31, has been charged by federal complaint with unlawful possession of a firearm by a prohibited person...According to the complaint, at 2:55 a.m. on May 23, Centralia police officers responded to complaints of loud noise at a house party on North Maple Street. When officers approached to address the noise and multiple cars blocking the road, Wilks reportedly stood in front of a crowd of roughly 70 people and threatened the officers with physical violence if they came onto his property without a warrant. Wilks allegedly told one of the officers, “You all come up on my property there is going to be a shooting. I know my rights. You can’t come anywhere on my property and do a damn thing, or I will shoot a cop’s [expletive] ass.” Wilks also allegedly told police that if they tried to arrest him, they would have to shoot him. Officers were reportedly able to maintain calm with the crowd and avoid a violent incident...in the days following, law enforcement received information from numerous sources that Wilks had several guns in the house during the party and that he had said he was going to “kill a cop” and have a shootout with police if the officers attempted to break up the party. On May 25, George Floyd died in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after a police officer knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes while Floyd lay handcuffed face down in the street. This incident has led to widespread public outrage and ongoing protests across America. On May 26, Wilks allegedly posted on Facebook, “This is exactly why I told them bitches Friday night I’ma put a shotgun shell in they ass if they step on my property [without] a warrant or some form of probable cause....” Officers also allegedly observed other recent posts where Wilks appeared to threaten violence to police. On June 2, law enforcement officers were advised that Wilks and others were discussing plans to organize a protest and then cause a riot in Centralia. Wilks reportedly discussed shooting police officers and the individuals allegedly created a list of specific officers they planned to shoot. On June 4, law enforcement executed a federal search warrant at the residence on North Maple Street and found a 9mm pistol, a rifle, and a 12 gauge shotgun. According to the complaint, someone had attempted to obliterate the serial number on the shotgun, but it was still visible. The complaint alleges that Wilks and one other adult were present at the home during the execution of the search warrant. Wilks allegedly has a prior conviction for domestic battery in Marion County. Federal law prohibits a person who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence from knowingly possessing a firearm.

According to court documents, in the early morning hours of July 13, 2020, a firefighting crew was working to put out a fire burning in the middle of an intersection in downtown Portland that was blocking traffic. A crowd of approximately 300 people were in the immediate area, some of whom were assaulting police officers and committing acts of vandalism and property damage. A firefighter, who was wearing a grey uniform with a large medic patch, was walking across the street to brief his team when he was shot in the chest with a round metal ball bearing. The firefighter said the shot came from a protester armed with a “wrist rocket” style slingshot. A Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office deputy saw the suspect on camera and identified Bates as the slingshot shooter. Bates was also identified by his clothing. At approximately 3:50 a.m, law enforcement officers spotted Bates near a white tent in Lownsdale Square holding a crowbar. When officers confronted him and told him he was under arrest, Bates ran with the crowbar in hand. After receiving a less lethal munition to his backside, Bates dropped the crowbar and was taken into custody. He was later released. On August 25, 2020, detectives from Seattle Police Department’s Robbery Unit received Bates’ outstanding federal arrest warrant and promptly issued a department-wide notice.

He was arraigned on that charge and was released on his personal recognizance. A Gerstein affidavit, based on an initial report from a responding officer, was filed along with the information. It states that at about 12:30 am on August 28, 2020, a Metropolitan Police Department officer was holding a police line at 14 and F Street NW when the defendant kicked his bicycle and fled. The officer pursued, and the defendant punched the officer in the left side of his face. The affidavit further reports that the officer sustained a laceration and severe swelling above his left eye, was transported to the hospital, and received stitches. A supplemental Gerstein affidavit filed after the initial report was prepared which clarified that a preliminary review of body worn camera showed that the individual kicking the bicycle and the individual throwing the punch appear to be wearing different color shirts.

Adam Green,Federal,United States,New York,Rochester,"18:231.F - defendant did knowingly and intentionally commit and attempt to commit an act to obstruct, impede and interfere with a law enforcement officer",,,,,20,Male,White/Caucasian,"""...Two defendants have been arrested and charged in separate complaints with civil disorder for their roles in violent weekend protests in the City of Rochester. Adam Green, 20, of Dansville, NY, and Dallas Williams-Smothers, 20, of Rochester, NY, each face five years in prison if convicted. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brett A. Harvey, who is handling the case, stated that according to the criminal complaints, there were two nights of violent protests in Rochester following the public disclosure on September 2, 2020, of Daniel Prude’s death on March 30, 2020, one week after an encounter he had with RPD police officers. Those violent protests resulted in property damage and physical injury to several Rochester Police Department (RPD) police officers. As alleged, during the evening of September 5, 2020, a group of approximately 1,500 protesters gathered at the intersection of Broad Street and Exchange Boulevard, located a block north of RPD headquarters. The protestors blocked all lanes of traffic on Broad Street and all lanes of traffic on Exchange Boulevard between Broad Street and Main Street. The group extended from the intersection of Broad Street and Exchange Boulevard to the intersection of State Street and Main Street. As a result, law enforcement officers shut down Exit 14 on Interstate 490 in Rochester for approximately eight hours and the State Street exit on the Inner Loop in the City of Rochester for approximately one hour. Protestors were repeatedly asked by an RPD sound truck to leave the area on the sidewalks or be subject to arrest for Disorderly Conduct for impeding traffic. Several members of the group disregarded those messages, remained in the streets, and continued to block the intersection. Defendant Green – who was wearing a black helmet and carrying a makeshift wooden shield – was part of the group that refused to disperse. Thereafter, RPD declared an unlawful assembly because of the criminal activity, which included protestors hurling rocks, bottles, lit fireworks and other objects, shining flashlights, and pointing lasers at police officers. In an effort to clear the intersection, RPD officers approached the remaining members of the crowd who refused to leave. As one officer approached defendant Green, he swung the wooden shield that he was carrying, striking the officer in the forehead portion of his helmet.

Dallas Williams-Smothers,Federal,United States,New York,Rochester,"18:231.F - defendant did knowingly and intentionally commit and attempt to commit an act to obstruct, impede and interfere with law enforcement officers",,,,,20,Male,Black/African/African American,"""...Two defendants have been arrested and charged in separate complaints with civil disorder for their roles in violent weekend protests in the City of Rochester. Adam Green, 20, of Dansville, NY, and Dallas Williams-Smothers, 20, of Rochester, NY, each face five years in prison if convicted. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brett A. Harvey, who is handling the case, stated that according to the criminal complaints, there were two nights of violent protests in Rochester following the public disclosure on September 2, 2020, of Daniel Prude’s death on March 30, 2020, one week after an encounter he had with RPD police officers. Those violent protests resulted in property damage and physical injury to several Rochester Police Department (RPD) police officers. As alleged, during the evening of September 5, 2020, a group of approximately 1,500 protesters gathered at the intersection of Broad Street and Exchange Boulevard, located a block north of RPD headquarters. The protestors blocked all lanes of traffic on Broad Street and all lanes of traffic on Exchange Boulevard between Broad Street and Main Street. The group extended from the intersection of Broad Street and Exchange Boulevard to the intersection of State Street and Main Street. As a result, law enforcement officers shut down Exit 14 on Interstate 490 in Rochester for approximately eight hours and the State Street exit on the Inner Loop in the City of Rochester for approximately one hour. Protestors were repeatedly asked by an RPD sound truck to leave the area on the sidewalks or be subject to arrest for Disorderly Conduct for impeding traffic. Several members of the group disregarded those messages, remained in the streets, and continued to block the intersection. Defendant Green – who was wearing a black helmet and carrying a makeshift wooden shield – was part of the group that refused to disperse. Thereafter, RPD declared an unlawful assembly because of the criminal activity, which included protestors hurling rocks, bottles, lit fireworks and other objects, shining flashlights, and pointing lasers at police officers. In an effort to clear the intersection, RPD officers approached the remaining members of the crowd who refused to leave. As one officer approached defendant Green, he swung the wooden shield that he was carrying, striking the officer in the forehead portion of his helmet. After being told he was under arrest, Green resisted and fought with the officer and another officer who was assisting. Green was eventually handcuffed and arrested. The officer suffered a cut and abrasion on the bridge of his nose from being struck in the head by the wooden shield. At approximately 11:20 p.m. that night, an RPD officer observed Williams-Smothers ignite a mortar-style, commercial grade firework and throw it at a line of uniformed RPD officers as they attempted to address a crowd at the intersection of State Street and Main Street. The firework detonated in the immediate vicinity of the officers, causing a loud explosion and creating a risk of serious injury to the officers. Williams-Smothers then fled the area on foot. After a physical description of the defendant was communicated to RPD personnel, he was apprehended and arrested in the area of 4 Commercial Street. At the time of his arrest, officers searched several pouches that were attached to a belt Williams-Smothers was wearing.

Publicly available social media posts show that the person who set fire to the police car parked at the loading dock of the Santa Monic Civic Center was wearing certain clothing and accessories, had an American flag bandana over his face, and had a distinctive tattoo of a rifle on his left arm, according to an affidavit filed with the complaint. The witness directed authorities to one of Wilson’s social media accounts – an Instagram account under the handle “yup_i_eat_crayons” – where Wilson had posted a “selfie” taken in Santa Monica on May 31. In his Instagram selfie, Wilson appeared exactly like the person seen in other social media posts who stoked the fire that destroyed the police car, the affidavit alleges. In early June, the FBI and the Santa Monica Police Department issued a wanted poster for the person later identified as Wilson. After receiving tips and conducting investigations, law enforcement was not able to identify the perpetrator who caused the fire that destroyed the police car. That changed when Wilson became a suspect in a September 28 vehicle arson that occurred in Irvine, according to the affidavit. Following a domestic dispute that culminated with a fire in a vehicle owned by Wilson’s live-in partner, authorities obtained information that linked Wilson to the May 31 fire in Santa Monica. Wilson was taken into custody on October 9 when Santa Monica Police officers, in conjunction with the Irvine Police Department and the FBI, executed a search warrant at the Irvine residence and found Wilson hiding in a mattress box spring in the bedroom. During that search, authorities recovered items of clothing that appear to be the same seen on Wilson in the various photos taken near the destroyed police car.

The Boogaloo Bois are a loosely-connected group of individuals who espouse violent anti-government sentiments. The term “Boogaloo” itself references an impending second civil war in the United States and is associated with violent uprisings against the government...between May 27 and May 28, 2020, HUNTER, who claims to be a member of the Boogaloo Bois, traveled in interstate commerce from Texas to Minneapolis, Minnesota, with the intent to participate in a riot. Federal agents reviewed a video taken on the night of May 28, 2020, that shows an individual, later identified as HUNTER, discharged 13 rounds from an AK-47 style semi automatic rifle into the Minneapolis Police Department’s Third Precinct building. At the time of the shooting there were other individuals believed to be looters still inside the building.

HUNTER, the front seat passenger, had six loaded magazines for an AK-47 style assault rifle affixed to a tactical vest he was wearing. Officers found three semi-automatic rifles on the rear seat of the vehicle, one loaded pistol in plain view next to the driver’s seat, and another loaded pistol in the center console. Several days after the traffic stop, federal agents became aware of HUNTER’s online affiliation with Boogaloo Bois member Steven Carrillo, who has been charged in the Northern District of California with the May 29, 2020, murder of a Federal Protective Service Officer in Oakland, California.

According to court documents, late on the evening of October 6, 2020 and into October 7, a crowd gathered and a march began at Elizabeth Caruthers Park located in the 3500 block of South Moody Avenue. The group walked to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building on South Macadam Avenue. Portland Police Bureau (PPB) officers observed many in the crowd carrying shields, wearing helmets, gas masks, and body armor. As the group marched towards the ICE building, support vehicles followed them as they blocked streets. As the crowd arrived at the ICE building, people in the crowd were observed flashing lights in the eyes of Federal Protection Service (FPS) officers as they stood outside the ICE building. People in the crowd were observed throwing rocks at the FPS officers and at one point, someone in the crowd threw a flaming object onto the roof of the ICE building. Due to the criminal acts, FPS officers moved the crowd back towards Elizabeth Caruthers Park. Later, the crowd again began marching towards the ICE building, blocking the streets. The PPB incident commander declared the event an unlawful assembly and the crowd was given multiple warnings over a loudspeaker to leave the area or face possible arrest, use of crowd control munitions to include tear gas. The crowd did not leave the area, but remained in the middle of the street. A PPB officer assigned to the Rapid Response Team, deputized as a U.S. Marshal to protect federal personnel and property during civil disorder events, observed a subject later identified as Skyler Roy Rider, holding a distinct blue and white umbrella, in a line of others blocking the street holding shields. The PPB officer determined there was probable cause to arrest Rider for disorderly conduct and interfering with a peace officer. As the officer approached Rider to arrest him, Rider lowered the umbrella with both hands and forcibly jabbed the officer in the chest with the pointed end of the umbrella. The force caused the officer to gasp and curl over in pain. Rider ran from the officer and other officers came to assist and placed Rider into custody for assaulting a public safety officer. Following the arrest of Rider, he was found to be dressed in all black wearing a gas mask and body armor. In his pockets were two water bottles. Video was later viewed by the PPB officer showing Rider throwing a water bottle at FPS officers earlier in the evening.

Both incidents occurred during violent civil unrest in Philadelphia on May 30, 2020. Following peaceful protests in Philadelphia in the early afternoon of May 30, 2020 in response to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, MN, civil unrest began to unfold later that afternoon that resulted in widespread looting, burglary, arson, destruction of property, and other violent acts. On that day, PPD Civil Affairs Car C-109 was parked on the north side of City Hall near Broad and Market Streets. During the violent episodes that began in the vicinity of City Hall that afternoon, defendants Matchett, Miller, and Smith allegedly placed combustible materials into the vehicle, after a road flare placed in the vehicle started a fire. As a result of these acts, the PPD vehicle was destroyed. A grand jury charged each of the defendants with two counts of arson, and one count of obstructing law enforcement in the commission of their duties during a civil disorder. On the same day and at roughly the same time, PSP troopers responded to the intersection of Broad and Vine Streets, a few blocks north of City Hall. PSP placed two patrol sport utility vehicles – marked as K1-7 and K1-17 – at the on-ramp for I-676 in an effort to prevent protestors from gaining access to the highway. Soon thereafter, a group of individuals began attacking the two vehicles. The windows of the vehicles were shattered and PSP equipment stored inside was stolen, including road flares, fire extinguishers, and “riot bags” containing additional PSP-issued equipment. Tabri allegedly threw a lit road flare into K1-17, igniting a fire that engulfed the SUV.

(DOJ press release)""",54,Male,,"""Brian Maiorana, a resident of Staten Island, [was charged with] threatening to kill and ordering others to kill protestors, politicians and law enforcement in retaliation for the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election...beginning in September 2020, Maiorana used a social media platform to post multiple threats to kill protestors, politicians and law enforcement officers and to encourage others to do the same. For example, on October 19, 2020, Maiorana posted that “[i]ts come to the point where pipe bombs need to be thrown into these mobs of potentially non violent violent protesters.” On November 8, 2020, Maiorana posted: “Soap Box, Ballot Box…that was fraudulently stolen from us, Now Cartridge Box,” a reference to ammunition or “cartridges.” On November 8, 2020, following the news media’s projection of the result of the 2020 Presidential Election, Maiorana posted that “The Turner Diaries must come to life. We blow up the FBI building for real. All the alphabet agencies assassination will become the new normal now . . . that the electoral process is finished.” The “Turner Diaries”—a 1978 novel influential among white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups—depicts an overthrow of the U.S. federal government, nuclear war, and ultimately, the extermination of non-whites. It has been cited as inspiration for numerous acts of terrorism, including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Following Maiorana’s arrest, the FBI executed a search warrant at his residence and seized, among other things, a semiautomatic firearm and ammunition.
